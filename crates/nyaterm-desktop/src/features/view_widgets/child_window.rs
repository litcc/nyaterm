//! Shared open/placement/keyboard policy for secondary windows.
//!
//! Each feature still owns its own window state and view, but the parts that
//! were copied five times live here: the `WindowOptions` construction, where a
//! child window is placed, and the close keybinding.
//!
//! Placement is the reason this module exists at all. Every site used to call
//! `Bounds::centered(None, size, cx)`, and `Bounds::centered` resolves `None` to
//! `cx.primary_display()` -- so with the main window on a second monitor every
//! child window opened on the *first* one. The pre-GPUI implementation centred
//! on the parent's monitor (`center_child_in_parent_monitor`); this restores
//! that.
