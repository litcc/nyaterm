//! Debounced durable writes for open tabs, window layout and UI layout.
//!
//! These three used to be dirty flags drained by the runtime tick's idle plane,
//! which made them a recurring defect: the flag's only driver was that plane, the
//! plane only ran off the quiet cadence, and so every flag had to be named in
//! `runtime_quiet_tick_allowed` or silently never flush. That went wrong three
//! times, most recently for `ui_layout_persist_pending` (`4644195a`), where a
//! header-status change was applied to state and never written.
//!
//! Now a single task owns them. A mark signals a wake, the task waits out a
//! coalescing window, and then writes whatever is still dirty -- so a new flag
//! cannot be added without a writer, and no central predicate needs to know they
//! exist.
