//! Keeping the remote panes' derived state in step with things they cannot observe.
//!
//! `RemoteOpsFeatureState` maintains its own invariant: every mutator that changes the
//! data, the query, the sort or the tab recomputes the derived list and re-clamps the
//! stored scroll offsets. That is why the render pass no longer needs `&mut` access.
//!
//! One input is outside the state's reach. The process table hides its memory and user
//! columns at narrow widths, and the sort key has to be constrained to the columns that
//! are actually shown -- but the panel width lives in `ShellFeatureState`. So the app
//! pushes it in, from the three places it can change.
