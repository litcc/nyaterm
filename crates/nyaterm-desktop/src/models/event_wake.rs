//! Edge-triggered wake for a queue that coalesces.
//!
//! Several queues in this crate merge or drop entries as they are pushed: the
//! terminal frame queue compacts consecutive output, the RDP and VNC session
//! queues keep only the newest frame, and the credential-autofill queue keeps
//! only the latest match per prompt. None of them can be replaced by a channel
//! without losing that behaviour, so the queue stays where it is and only the
//! *signal* moves here.
//!
//! [`EventWake::arm`] declares interest; the first [`EventWake::signal`] after an
//! arm sends exactly one wake and clears the interest again. A producer flooding
//! the queue therefore costs one wake per drain cycle rather than one per entry,
//! which is the property that makes this usable on the paths where a poll would
//! otherwise be the only affordable option.
//!
//! Interests are a bitmask so a consumer waiting for one kind of entry is not
//! woken -- and so disarmed -- by another kind arriving. A queue carrying one
//! kind can use [`ANY_INTEREST`] throughout.
//!
//! # Ordering: arm before checking for work
//!
//! A consumer must arm *before* it looks for work, not after:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! loop {
//!     wake.arm(ANY_INTEREST);
//!     if drain_found_work() {
//!         continue;
//!     }
//!     if wake_rx.next().await.is_none() {
//!         break;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Checking first and arming afterwards loses a producer that pushed in between:
//! the check saw an empty queue, the arm came too late to make that push signal,
//! and the consumer then sleeps on a queue that already has work in it until
//! something unrelated happens to arrive. Arming first can instead produce one
//! redundant wake -- the next iteration drains nothing and goes back to sleep --
//! which is harmless.
