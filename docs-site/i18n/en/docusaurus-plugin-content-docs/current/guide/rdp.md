# RDP Remote Desktop

An RDP session connects to a Windows host or any other remote desktop serving RDP. It shares tabs, split panes, and the saved-connection system with terminal sessions, but it carries a graphical framebuffer rather than a text terminal.

RDP protocol decoding runs in a separate helper process. When running from source you must build the helper first, or connections fail with `HelperMissing` — see [Development Setup](../development/setup#rdp--vnc-need-their-helpers-built-first).

## Connection configuration

### Basics

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Host / Port | RDP service address; default port `3389` |
| Username | Login user |
| Domain | Active Directory domain; leave empty for standalone hosts |
| Password | Login password |

### Security

**Network Level Authentication** (NLA / CredSSP) is used when the remote host supports it.

**Certificate policy** decides what happens on first contact with an unknown certificate:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Prompt on unknown certificate | Opens a verification dialog and lets you decide (default) |
| Reject untrusted certificates | Refuses without asking |
| Accept for this session only | Accepts without recording trust, so the next connection asks again |

With **Prompt on unknown certificate**, the dialog can accept just this connection or accept and remember the certificate. If a remembered certificate later changes, you are prompted again before connecting.

### Display

**Display mode** is either **Fit window** (default) or **Fixed size**. Fixed size requires explicit dimensions:

- Width from **640 to 7680**
- Height from **480 to 4320**

The default resolution is 1920×1080 at 32-bit color depth.

### Clipboard

**Clipboard** is **text only** (default) or disabled. File, image, and rich-text clipboard channels are not supported.

### Reconnect

**Auto reconnect** is on by default and retries a limited number of times on transient network failures. **Retry attempts** accepts **0 to 20**, defaulting to 5.

## Capability boundaries

RDP sessions do not offer these SSH-only capabilities:

- Terminal command history and command suggestions
- The SFTP file explorer
- SSH proxy, jump hosts, and tunnels
- Remote host monitoring panels

Use SSH, Local Terminal, Telnet, or Serial sessions when you need command-line capabilities.

## Error kinds

The error kind on a failed connection narrows down where to look:

| Kind | Common cause |
|------|--------------|
| `Authentication` | Wrong username, password, or domain; NLA requirements unmet |
| `CertificateRejected` | The certificate policy refused the server certificate |
| `ConnectionRefused` / `Timeout` | Port unreachable, firewall block, or RDP not enabled on the host |
| `Tls` / `Negotiation` | TLS handshake or protocol negotiation failed |
| `HelperMissing` | The helper executable is not beside the application |
| `HelperCrashed` | The helper process exited during a live session |
