# Themes & Appearance

NyaTerm lets you tune the workspace appearance in fairly fine detail, including UI theme, terminal theme, fonts, and cursor behavior.

## UI theme and terminal theme

In **Settings → Appearance**, you can configure these separately:

- **UI Theme** — controls the app-wide color scheme
- **Terminal Theme** — controls terminal colors, or can follow the UI theme

If you just want a quick theme switch, you can also use **View → Theme** from the top menu.

The theme list includes two high-contrast themes, suited for accessibility, bright environments, or screen sharing:

- **Nya HC** — high contrast on a dark base
- **Nya HC White** — high contrast on a light base

Select them like any other UI theme from **Settings → Appearance** or the **View → Theme** top menu.

## Minimum contrast

**Settings → Appearance → Minimum contrast** automatically adjusts the terminal foreground color when it sits too close to the background, so a remote program's color choices stay readable under your current theme. Available steps:

| Step | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Off | No adjustment; colors render exactly as the remote sends them |
| Slight boost | At least 3:1 contrast |
| Recommended: WCAG AA | At least 4.5:1 contrast |
| High contrast: WCAG AAA | At least 7:1 contrast |
| Maximum | At least 21:1 contrast, i.e. forced to pure black or white |

It only affects how terminal output is rendered; it does not change the theme's own color definitions.

## Background image

In **Settings → Appearance**, the main window can use a local wallpaper:

- **Background Image** — choose the local file rendered behind the main workspace
- **Image Sizing** — choose how the image is shown with `cover`, `contain`, `stretch`, or `tile`
- **Image Opacity** — control how strongly the wallpaper shows through the theme
- **Background Content Opacity** — control how translucent workspace panels and content surfaces become; lower values make the wallpaper more visible

This only affects the main window workspace. Settings and child windows stay solid so forms, dialogs, and secondary windows remain readable.

## Fonts and font size

In **Settings → Appearance**, you can adjust:

- **Font family** — primary font plus multi-level fallback fonts
- **Terminal font size**
- **UI font size**

The default font family is `JetBrains Mono, Noto Sans SC Variable, Inter`: the terminal falls back to `JetBrains Mono` and the UI falls back to `Inter`.

These are **font names, not font files shipped with the app**. NyaTerm resolves them from your system-installed fonts, so on a machine without `JetBrains Mono` the terminal falls back to the platform's default monospace font. If you want this exact stack, install the fonts yourself.

The font picker lists system-installed fonts so you can build a fallback chain, and the terminal font dropdown only offers families that measure as monospace. System font discovery runs asynchronously, so you may briefly see `Loading system fonts...` when opening the picker; you can still type a font name in the meantime.

## Cursor

Appearance settings also expose terminal details such as:

- **Cursor style** — Block / Underline / Bar
- **Cursor blink**

If you switch between dark and light themes often, it is worth checking the terminal theme together with keyword highlighting and action links so the overall result stays readable.

## Language switching

NyaTerm currently provides:

- Simplified Chinese
- English

You can switch language in either of these places:

- **Settings → General → Language**
- **View → Language** in the top menu

## Panels and workspace appearance

Besides colors and fonts, the workspace itself can be tuned to match your habits:

- Left and right panel widths are resizable
- Split ratios inside a tab are resizable
- Left and right activity bars can be shown or hidden quickly with shortcuts

These layout states are saved with app settings, which makes it practical to keep a preferred long-term workspace arrangement.

## Zoom and quick adjustments

NyaTerm provides these common shortcuts:

- **Zoom In** — `Ctrl / Cmd + =`
- **Zoom Out** — `Ctrl / Cmd + -`
- **Reset Zoom** — `Ctrl / Cmd + 0`

These are especially useful for demos, screen sharing, or high-DPI displays.
